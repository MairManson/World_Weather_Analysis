# Customer Travel Destinations App
## Objective

Collect worldwide latitude and longitude data and include a prompt which allows users to enter their minimum and maximum weather preferences, that are then used to identify potential travel destinations. From the list of potential destinations, users will choose up to four cities in their preferred country to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, chart a travel route between the four cities with a marker layer that includes a nearby hotel and the city's current weather conditions.
